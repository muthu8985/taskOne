    To the casual observer, all software testing and <ins>Quality Assurance (QA)</ins>
    seems to be created equal.yet, to those engrossed in the profession, there are so many 
    different flavors, or types, of software testing that can be used to evaluate the performance and reliability of a design.</pre

 However, knowing where and when to deploy each type of software testing is key. And it begins with knowing the ins-and-outs of each type so they can be used at the right time.
 wo types, smoke testing and sanity testing, can be particularly useful in stress testing software during development, but hard to difficult to distinguish from one another. 
 Here’s what you need to know about each method, their strengths, and use cases.
    </pre>
    <h1>Smoke Testing: What You Need to Know</h1>
    <pre>
    Smoke testing is more of a preliminary assessment method designed to verify whether the core functionalities 
    of a software system are in place and are operational. Its primary aim is to identify significant issues early in
    the development cycle as possible, thus preventing further complications down the line that could result in costly rework.</pre

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scope: Deployed broadly across the entire system or application.</li>
      <li>
        Frequency: Often executed after every new build or release to ensure
        basic stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Executionspeed: Intended to be deployed quickly, focusing on essential
        functionalities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-size: x-large">Examples:</span>
    <h3>Testing login functionality in a web application</h3>
    <pre>
  An e-commerce website needs to update its payment processing system. 
  After implementing these changes, smoke testing would involve quickly
  navigating through the checkout process to ensure the website remains 
  accessible and functional. If the website crashes during this process,
  indicating a critical fault, developers are alerted to address the issue
  before proceeding with more detailed testing.</pre>
  <h3>Verifying database connectivity in a system</h3>
  <pre>A desktop application was designed to calculate taxes, billing, and salaries for a business. 
  If the application incorrectly calculates basic formulas smoke testing would stop further testing 
  until this fundamental error is corrected. </pre>
  <h3>Sanity Testing: What You Need to Know</h3>
  <pre>Sanity testing is a targeted evaluation of specific functionalities or components following minor 
  modifications or bug fixes. This type of testing confirms that recent changes have not adversely affected
  the system's behavior.</pre>
  <span style="font-size: xx-large;">Characteristics</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Scope : Concentrated on particular features or affected modules.</li>
    <li>Frequency: Conducted after minor adjustments or corrections to ensure that the changes work as intended.</li>
    <li>Executionspeed :Provides a more detailed examination compared to smoke testing, but is less extensive than full regression testing.</li>
  </ul>
  <span style="font-size: xx-large">Examples:</span><br>

  <span style="font-size: large;">Testing new user interface (UI) elements added</span>
  <pre>When new UI elements are added to an existing feature in a software application, 
    sanity testing would focus on verifying that these new elements integrate seamlessly
    with the rest of the feature. This might involve checking that buttons, menus, or 
    other interactive elements function correctly and do not introduce new errors or
    disrupt existing functionality.</pre>
    <span sryle ="font-size: large">Validating performance improvements in a module</span>
    <pre>After modifying workflow elements in a module, sanity testing could validate
    performance improvements. For instance, if a page that usually loaded slowly was optimized,
    sanity testing would confirm that the page now loads faster without sacrificing functionality
    or introducing new issues.</pre>
